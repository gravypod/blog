This question came up recently and I thought I'd write a more detailed blog post about it. If you're a programmer and use the computer for any extent of time you're likely going to run into problems. When this situation arises you have a few options that present themselves

1. Buy someone else's software
2. Use someone else's freeware
3. Write your own

This is what hiring managers are talking about when they say "side projects". A "side project" is a project you start to aid in the completion of another goal. This is inherent to the name of such a piece of software. Many people think that a "side project" is meant to be a huge and complicated piece of software but it is not. To request of a new student, or even a long time employee, to spend a majority of their time on side projects is insane and instead you are expected to have run into problems that have prevented you from doing something you are actually interested in doing. These problems should usually have software-related solutions. I've got a few pretty good examples of this from my own development history.

* [Write plugins/event handlers for a game which I was running a server for](https://github.com/gravypod/StarmadeWrapper)
* [Learn the material for the to take the HAM radio license exam](https://ham.joshuakatz.me/exam)
* [Search for an x220t that's hopefully under $200](https://github.com/gravypod/BargeIn)
* [Automate grading homeworks for my TA job](https://github.com/gravypod/GradeO)
* [Uptime monitoring for my game server](https://github.com/gravypod/Checkers)
* [Log formatting and parsing to help me identify what's goind on](https://github.com/gravypod/Starmade-Log-Reader)
* [A CI server to help distribute up-to-date builds of another project](https://github.com/gravypod/AllAdminCI/)
* A media server system to organize my movies, music, and books (no link)

These are all things to help me do other things I wanted to do. This is a list of stepping stools I've built in an attempt to get to something I couldn't previously do. Each one of these tasks had a ready-made solution (even #1) where someone is willing to sell you their solution to the problem. I think the best thing that someone should want to do in this case is to say "screw you" and write their own implementation for free. Doing this actually builds something. It accomplishes something. You've built a solution to a problem, developed it to a state where you think it's acceptable, then gave it out to the world where people who couldn't necesarily build their own software or pay for the expensive implementation can use yours instead.

Writing your own software isn't just something you should be doing to look cool. The people who wrote and maintain large software libraries like Django don't do it for a job or to make themselves look better to their peers. Django fell into their plate because it was a tool that let them approch a problem they weren't previously able to solve in this mannor. There usually are already off the shelf solutions to these problems but if you can't afford them or could easily write them yourself it is better to do so. It's the best way to learn about how they work and get yourself up to speed.
