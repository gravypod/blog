I've always wanted to make the transition from Windows to Linux as my main OS. Due to college, my gaming habits have had to die down. Rather then running through Fallout New Vegas for the 1000th time, I've been running through my math and physics textbooks. 

Because of this, my transition to a full-time GNU/Linux user was possible. I decided to start out at college by changing my daily driver laptop to a Thinkpad X220 I got off craigslist. I ran xubuntu on it and had a fairly perfect "It just works" experience -- I'm fairly certain Todd Howard would be proud. I was able to do all of my class work and the programming I like to do on the platform, and without gaming as Window's last crutch I was able to make a full transition rather smoothly. 

That was all well and good, but when I came back home for weekends and breaks I hated going back to my sluggish old Windows machine. To fix this, I decided to build an extremely low-budget computer that could run a GNU/Linux distribution and some IDEs that I need. I built it on a AMD AM1 5350 CPU.

The cost was easily under $150 USD. I even had a spare drive I pulled from my Windows computer. This makes it an extremely affordable system and extremely robust. This build is so low powered it can run on a 65W non-OEM charger. I should be able to see savings on my power bill as have an easier time transitioning to a solar/battery bank system for my house.

I've been running stock Ubuntu 16.04 on this system and I have no complaints thus far. IntelliJ and other Jet Brains IDEs run well on it, even without power saver mode.

There are only two improvements I'd make to this system

* Use a half-sized mini-PCIe ssd rather than a SATA drive.
* Use a (Arctic Alpine M1 Passive Heat Sink)[https://www.amazon.com/Arctic-Alpine-Passive-Cooling-ACALP00005A/dp/B00U8PUNH2]

With those two additions, there will be no moving parts. The only remaining cables to manage will be for the case's front panel IO.
